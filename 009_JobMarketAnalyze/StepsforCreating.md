##Following are steps maintained during the project creation:
- load the data into PowerBi and check for the quality of the data especially for any inconsistency or null values.
- After loading data into PowerBI using powerQuery we do our initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check basic statistics for our dataset.
- By going to the view menu and then column distribution and profile we can check the statistics of the particular columns.
- After completing the EDA process we can start creating our dashboard.
